In Danish director Thomas Vinterberg’s latest film, Another Round, friends Martin, Tommy, Peter and Nikolaj agree to conduct a little experiment: they will stay moderately drunk throughout the day to see how it affects their social and professional performance.
The four middle-aged men are dissatisfied with their jobs as teachers at a gymnasium school in Copenhagen.
At Nikolaj’s 40th birthday, they discuss Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skårderud, who alleges that people have a natural alcohol deficiency, and that having a blood alcohol content of 0.
05% makes you more creative and relaxed.
The band of friends embark on the experiment, recording their “findings” in an essay.
The ground rules – initially – are that blood alcohol should not fall below 0.
05% and drinking should only take place during work hours.
The teachers cite Hemingway and Churchill as their inspirations.
“I haven’t felt this good in ages,” Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) says in the early stages of their experiment.
But things don’t stay that way.
Soon the men increase their dose and things get out of hand, with one of the men – Tommy (Thomas Larsen) – drinking way too much.
Another Round is undoubtedly good entertainment, but for those looking for a productivity or creativity boost, Skårderud was originally making a light-hearted (and alcohol-inspired) point that he was quick to clarify after the film’s release.
But what if you could stick to the Another Round protocol – effectively microdosing small amounts of alcohol during working hours to improve performance? What would happen?
Blood alcohol concentration is affected by many things, including the alcohol content of the drink, how fast you drink, your sex, your body mass index, and the health of your liver.
But 0.
05% is approximately equivalent to a 70kg man drinking one pint (568ml) of 4% beer or a large glass (250ml) of wine.
As alcohol is a toxin, the body works to excrete it via breath, sweat and urine, and so maintaining a 0.
05% concentration would be difficult.
It would require regular measured consumption across the day, meaning that daily and weekly unit intake would soon exceed the maximum recommended levels.
Low doses of alcohol may have some positive effects.
While alcohol culture in countries like the UK can sometimes seem excessive, small amounts may increase sociability, helping people to create and maintain new friendship bonds and professional networks.
Laboratory studies have shown that at low doses the increases in relaxation and feelings of self-confidence that alcohol produce, and the loss of cognitive focus that comes with mild intoxication, may lead to more creative and diverse problem-solving strategies, improved foreign language skills, sharper memory recall, and a better ability to process some types of information.
In contrast, analytical problem-solving skills, such as those needed in most workplaces, suffer across all levels of consumption.
If all this sounds good, before you think about trying this experiment yourself, remember that these were all controlled lab studies administering single doses of alcohol, and there are some questions about how relevant the tests and assessments are to the real world of work.
Also, although there is individual variation, tolerance to the psychological and physiological effects of alcohol quickly develops even at low doses, which means that over time more of the drug is needed to achieve the same effects.
Alcohol “microdosing” may become ineffective, or soon turn into alcohol “macrodosing”, with more having to be drunk to maintain even larger blood-alcohol concentrations.
This is not only expensive, but most employers will have policies covering alcohol use in the workplace, with some safety-critical occupations having zero-tolerance approaches.
The harms of regular alcohol are well known.
It is linked to a range of cancers, digestive diseases, and other health and social harms to both the drinker and others.
There is longstanding academic debate about whether drinking moderate amounts of alcohol is good for your health, protecting against conditions such as heart disease.
Some researchers have proposed that there is a J-shaped relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and some types of harm, whereby there is a “sweet spot” of consumption that is beneficial.
But this idea is one that is often promoted by the alcohol industry for commercial benefit, and is undermined by weak evidence.
However, other researchers think there is no safe level of alcohol consumption – any amount is bad for your health.
Personal enhancement through alcohol is not a new idea.
The ancient Greeks notably promoted wine as an aid to debate, poetry and philosophical discussion, but perhaps wisely suggested a three-drink limit, as consuming any more meant overstepping personal capabilities.
Great figures in history – artists, writers, politicians, composers, scientists and industry leaders – have been famous tipplers.
Churchill, for example, would start the day with a whisky and water, and end it with a few glasses of scotch, champagne and a highball.
But the creativity and success of notable people came despite their use of alcohol.
For those of us with more modest talents, alcohol use is more likely to lead to a hangover and empty wallet than professional reward.
While humans have walked on the Moon and sent probes all over the solar system, our understanding of our own brain is still severely lacking.
We do not have complete knowledge of how brain structure, chemicals and connectivity interact to produce our thoughts and behaviours.
But this isn’t from an absence of ambition.
It is nearly eight years since the start of the Human Brain Project (HBP) in Europe, which aims to unravel the brain’s mysteries.
After a difficult start, the project has made substantial discoveries and innovation, relevant for tackling clinical disorders, as well as technological advances – and it has two more years to go.
It has also created EBRAINS, an open research infrastructure built on the scientific advances and tools developed by the project’s research teams, and making them available to the scientific community via a shared digital platform – a new achievement for collaborative research and instrumental in the achievements listed below.
The project has created a unique multilevel human brain atlas based on several aspects of brain organisation, including its structure on the smallest of scales, its function and connectivity.
This atlas provides a large number of tools to visualise data and work with them.
Researchers can automatically extract data from the atlas using a special tool to run a simulation for modelling the brains of specific patients.
This can help to inform clinicians of the optimal treatment option.
Using electron microscopy, a technique to study brain tissue at ultrahigh resolution, researchers have published detailed 3D-maps of around 25,000 synapses – electrical and chemical signals between brain cells – in the human hippocampus.
This region of the brain is involved in memory, learning and spatial navigation, and one of the first areas to be damaged early in Alzheimer’s disease.
The Human Brain Project is the first to provide a detailed picture of synaptic structure in this important area of the brain.
This could allow for a better understanding of diseases such as dementia, as well as aid in the development of computational models of the brain.
Due to its complexity, the human hand is one of the most difficult body parts to imitate.
While even small children can pick up and manipulate items, such as a cup of water, this has been a very difficult problem for robot hands.
The Shadow Robot Company, which participates in the Human Brain Project, designs and develops highly dexterous robotic hands to imitate the human hand as closely as possible.
One of the company’s recent inventions is the world’s first touch-based telerobot hand (see video above).
The robotic hand has 129 sensors and 24 joints and has very similar movements to those of human hands.
This allows for the ideal use of force and much finer manipulation of objects than that of previous robot hands.
This invention will be important in prosthetics, and also in industry including in manufacturing, space exploration, medicine and work in hazardous environments where you wouldn’t want to use your real hands – such as nuclear waste and with biologically dangerous substances.
The HBP scientists and Shadowrobot work together to give the robotic hands an even more human-like dexterity, with the help of neural networks.
The human brain comprises nearly 100 billion interconnected brain cells, which is part of the reason it is so difficult to model and understand.
Innovative computing has helped to further our understanding by simulating the exchange of signals between neurons, but even the best software run on the fastest supercomputers to date can only simulate 1% of the human brain.
The million-processor-core Spiking Neural Network Architecture or “SpiNNaker” machine boasts 100 million transistors on each of its 30,000 chips.
One such chip can simulate 16,000 neurons and 8 million synapses in real time.
This is comparable or even better than the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research so far.
But this is only the beginning.
The unique SpiNNaker doesn’t communicate by sending large amounts of information from point A to B via a standard network.
Instead it works more like the human brain and sends billions of small amounts of information simultaneously to thousands of different destinations, completely rethinking the way traditional computers work.
The SpiNNakker has the potential to overcome speed and power consumption problems of conventional supercomputers – something that is much needed if we are to crack the enigma of the human brain.
Ultimately, it could advance our understanding of neural processing in the brain, including in learning and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s.
Another important EBRAINS application was the development of a Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP).
This is a computer program based on personalised brain network models from individual patients.
This is achieved by integrating brain connectivity areas responsible for seizures and lesions for individual patients, detected by MRI.
Currently, clinicians use electroencephalogram (EEG), which provides a recording of brain activity, and helps to identify when and where a seizure begins.
However, this information alone does not tell the clinician all that they need for determining the type of seizure and making the best decisions in regard to treatment.
The model provides a personalised prediction of the impact of a surgical treatment for a certain patient.
The surgeon is then able to evaluate the impact of multiple different therapeutic strategies and determine the best treatment option, with the most successful outcome.
The program is close to commercial release.
As of September 2021, 1,497 peer-reviewed journal articles, many in high-impact journals, cite the Human Brain Project.
For example, in 2018 researchers published impressive work on neurotechnology restoring walking in patients with spinal cord injury in Nature.
In 2020, a team published in Science the most comprehensive atlas on the cellular architecture of the brain.
In the same year, researchers also discovered a specific type of action potentials in brain cells known as pyramidal cells and disclosed an important memory mechanism in the hippocampus.
A key objective going forward is to develop “foresight”, which is the practice of looking ahead to envision potential future developments and change.
Hopefully, we will one day crack the monumental challenge of understanding the human brain and discovering novel treatments for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders.
But it won’t be easy – it is, after all, harder than rocket science.
Recent queues at petrol stations across the UK point to significant issues with fuel supply chains in the wake of Brexit.
But a lack of fuel where it is needed has been causing problems in the UK for years.
Before the pandemic, an estimated 13.4% of households – that’s 3.18 million people – lived in fuel poverty in England.
According to research by fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, insufficiently heated homes kill nearly 10,000 people every year in the UK.
Now, we’re also facing the problem of sharp rises in gas prices.
This hits especially hard in countries such as the UK, where gas is the major fuel used to heat households.
These problems reflect the ongoing “energy trilemma”: how to provide households and businesses with stable, low-carbon and affordable energy.
By itself, nationalising energy systems wouldn’t solve all these problems.
Increasing public ownership of energy systems is one, more reasonable option.
The growing threat of climate change, outside influences such as Brexit, and market pressures driving price increases would still exist.
But publicly owned systems do have key advantages over their private counterparts.
Evidence suggests public ownership of gas and electricity grids alone would deliver huge savings to UK consumers compared with the current system.
Instead of paying out rewards to private company shareholders, publicly owned and controlled transmission systems would ensure any financial surplus is either reinvested to improve the service or used to reduce energy prices.
Private UK grid companies make good money supplying our energy needs.
